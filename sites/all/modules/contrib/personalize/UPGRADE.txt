Upgrading from Personalize-7.x-1.0-beta7 to Personalize-7.x-1.0-beta8 or later

  After upgrading the module code, DO NOT RUN update.php until after you've
  met the following conditions:

  * If you're also using the Acquia Lift module, update to its 7.x-1.0-beta8
    or higher module version.
  * Modify any custom code you may have that provides a visitor context plugin.
    The interface for Visitor Context plugins has changed. If you have any code
    on your site that implements PersonalizeContextInterface, note that the
    method signature for getPossibleValues() now takes a $limit parameter.
  * Ensure that personalize module and any modules providing visitor context
    plugins are enabled when you run the update, otherwise fixed targeting
    rules will be removed from your option sets.
