# Attention

All JavaScript files in this folder are copied directly from the navbar module.
The only change has been to pass the system-included Drupal.jQuery instance
in to anonymous functions rather than the generic jQuery object.

The navbar module is used as a model for the unified navigation that is shown
whenever navbar is not in use on a site.

If navbar is in use, the navbar module's implementation of these files is
used instead.
